# cbztools

In active development! Not stable at all, and features may change without any notice!

cbztools is a Go-based command-line utility for working with CBZ comic archives. It supports concatenating multiple `.cbz` files, resizing images, and splitting archives, with more tools planned for the future.

It preserves image order, uses natural sorting to determine chapter order, extracts metadata from ComicInfo.xml if available, and generates a sanitized output filename.

The tool should be especially useful for manga or comic series split across multiple CBZ files.

Tested only on MangaDex archives (for now).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cbzconcat.git
cd cbzconcat
```


2. Initialize modules and install dependencies:

```
go mod tidy
```


3. Build the binary:

**Option A: Using Makefile (recommended):**
```bash
make build
```

**Option B: Manual build with version info:**
```bash
# Get current version from git
VERSION=$(git describe --tags --always --dirty 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")
BUILD_TIME=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")

# Build with version injection
go build -ldflags "-X main.Version=$VERSION -X main.BuildTime=$BUILD_TIME -X main.GitCommit=$GIT_COMMIT" -o cbztools
```

**Option C: Simple build (no version info):**
```bash
go build -o cbztools
```

```
cbztools <command> [flags] [args]
```

### Commands

### Concat Command

```
cbztools concat [flags] <input_dir> <output_dir>
```

- `<input_dir>`: Directory containing CBZ files to merge.
- `<output_dir>`: Directory where the merged CBZ will be created.

**Flags:**
- `--verbose` : Verbose output (overrides silent mode).
- `--silent` : Silent mode; suppress stdout output except for errors.
- `--order` : Print the order of input CBZ files before merging.
- `--xml` : Print the resulting `ComicInfo.xml` content.

### Resize Command

```
cbztools resize [flags] <input_file> <output_file>
```

- `<input_file>`: CBZ file to resize.
- `<output_file>`: Path for the resized CBZ file.

**Flags:**
- `--verbose` : Verbose output (overrides silent mode).
- `--silent` : Silent mode; suppress stdout output except for errors.
- `--width` : Target width in pixels (default: 1024).

### Split Command

```
cbztools split [flags] <input.cbz> <output_dir>
```

- `<input.cbz>`: CBZ file to split.
- `<output_dir>`: Directory where the split CBZ files will be created.

**Flags:**
- `--verbose` : Verbose output (overrides silent mode).
- `--silent` : Silent mode; suppress stdout output except for errors.

### Version Command

```
cbztools version
```

Shows the version, build time, and git commit information.

---

## Examples

### Concatenate chapters
Merge a folder of chapters into one CBZ in the current directory, with the name extracted from the first chapter and sanitized; with verbose output:

```
cbztools concat --verbose ./Elf-san\ wa\ Yaserarenai .
```

This will produce a `./Elf-san_wa_Yaserarenai_Ch_0000-0047_6.cbz` file, with 0000-0047.6 being the chapters read from ComicInfo.xml from the first and the last chapters.

### Resize images
Resize all images in a CBZ file to 800px width:

```
cbztools resize --width 800 input.cbz output_resized.cbz
```

### Split a CBZ file
Split a large CBZ file into two smaller ones:

```
cbztools split large_volume.cbz ./output_dir/
```

This will create `large_volume_part1.cbz` and `large_volume_part2.cbz` in the output directory.

### Binary Naming

Built binaries include version information in their filenames:
- **Local builds**: `./build/cbztools-v1.2.3.linux.amd64` (version info embedded in binary)
- **Release builds**: `cbztools-v1.2.3.linux.amd64`, `cbztools-v1.2.3.win_amd64.exe`, etc.

This makes it easy to identify which version of the tool you're using and helps with managing multiple versions.

### Build Optimization

- **Development builds** (`make build`): Include debug symbols for easier debugging
- **Release builds** (`make release`): Optimized with stripped symbols (`-s -w`) for smaller, production-ready binaries

---

## Filename Sanitization

The tool replaces spaces and dots with underscores, removes filesystem-invalid characters, and can transliterate non-Latin characters to ASCII using [mozillazg/go-unidecode](https://github.com/mozillazg/go-unidecode).

Example:

"Vol.01 Ch.0001 - „ÅÇ„Å™„Åü„ÅØ„Å©„ÅÜ„Åß„Åô„Åã?.cbz"
‚Üí "Vol_01_Ch_0001_-_anataha_doudesuka.cbz"

---

## Chapter Sorting

### Chapter Detection
The tool uses sophisticated regex patterns to extract chapter numbers:

1. **Primary pattern**: Matches `Ch`, `Chap`, or `Chapter` followed by optional separators and numbers
   - Examples: `Ch0015`, `Ch-0015.5`, `Ch_0015.5.5`, `chapter 0015`
   - Supports various separators: space, dash, underscore, dot, colon, semicolon, comma, exclamation, question mark, tab, newline

2. **Fallback pattern**: If no chapter prefix is found, looks for any 3+ digit number
   - This helps with files that have chapter numbers without explicit "Ch" prefixes
   - 3+ digits are used to avoid matching volume numbers (which are typically 1-2 digits)

### Natural Sorting
- Splits chapter numbers by decimal points and compares each part numerically
- Ensures `Ch0015 < Ch0015.5 < Ch0016` and `Ch0015.5 < Ch0015.6`
- Files without detectable chapters are placed at the end
- Falls back to string comparison when no chapters are found

### Current Limitations
- **Volume handling**: Currently only extracts chapter numbers, not volume information
- **Mixed formats**: Files with both volume and chapter numbers may not sort optimally
- **Error handling**: Uses panic() for critical errors (will exit the program)

## Versioning and Building

This project uses git tags for versioning. The build process automatically injects version information into the binary.

### Version Information

The binary includes:
- **Version**: From git tags (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- **Build Time**: When the binary was compiled
- **Git Commit**: Short hash of the current commit

### Build Commands

```bash
# Show current version info
make version

# Install/update dependencies
make deps

# Build linux x86 binary without optimisations
make

# Build all platforms
make release

# Run tests
make test

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

**Note**: The Makefile is designed for both local development and CI/CD. It automatically detects whether it's running in GitHub Actions or locally and adjusts accordingly. The GitHub Actions workflows use the same Makefile targets to ensure consistency between local and automated builds.

### CI/CD Integration

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically:
- **Test**: Run tests on every push/PR to main/develop branches
- **Build**: Create versioned binaries for Linux and Windows platforms
- **Release**: Automatically create releases when git tags are pushed

All CI builds use the same Makefile targets (`make test`, `make build`, `make release`) ensuring consistency between local and automated builds.

### Git Tagging

To create a new version:
```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**Note**: After a successful release, the workflow automatically merges the `develop` branch into `main` to keep the main branch up-to-date with released code.
